# Entity-Relationship Data Model

- Specialization and generalization are fundamental concepts in database modeling that are useful for establishing superclass-subclass relationships.

## Specialization

  - Specialization is a top-down approach in which a higher-level entity is divided into multiple specialized lower-level entities.
  - In addition to sharing the attributes of the higher-level entity, these lower-level entities have specific attributes of their own.
  - Specialization is usually used to find subsets of an entity that has a few different or additional attributes.


## Generalization

  - Generalization is a bottom-up approach in which multiple lower-level entities are combined to form a single higher-level entity.
  - Generalization is usually used to find common attributes among entities to form a generalized entity.
  - It can also be thought of as the opposite of specialization.


## Aggregation

  - Aggregation refers to the process by which entities are combined to form a single meaningful entity. 
  - The specific entities are combined because they do not make sense on their own. 
  - To establish a single entity, aggregation creates a relationship that combines these entities. 
  - The resulting entity makes sense because it enables the system to function well.
