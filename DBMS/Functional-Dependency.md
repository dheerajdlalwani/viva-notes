# Functional Dependency

- The attributes of a table is said to be dependent on each other when an attribute of a table uniquely identifies another attribute of the same table
- If column A of a table uniquely identifies the column B of same table then it can represented as A->B (Attribute B is functionally dependent on attribute A)
